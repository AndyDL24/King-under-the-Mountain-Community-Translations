# Community Translations for King under the Mountain

This is the official community translations mod for [_King under the Mountain_](http://kingunderthemounta.in)

## Description

As _King under the Mountain_ is in active development, the text in the game is 
constantly being added to. Until release, it would not be feasible to produce 
a complete translation into the main languages as they would quickly fall out of date 
with each new release of the game.

The intention for this mod (and this git repository) is that the CSV files 
in the [translations](./translations) directory will be kept up to date with contributions from
the game's developers and community. 

## How to Contribute

Ideally, additions and modifications to the translations will be performed on Github
via pull requests to the main project. If you'd like to contribute but aren't comfortable 
using git and Github, you can download and edit the relevant .csv file from [/translations](./translations)
and email your changes to ross@kingunderthemounta.in

Ideally, also please join the [game's Discord](https://discord.gg/qF2S3tf) and jump into the #translations channel.
